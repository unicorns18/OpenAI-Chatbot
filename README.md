# Scarlett (OpenAI chatbot)

Scarlett is a chatbot I thought would be a great idea for people who are bored, need a chatbot and don't want to develop one themselves. Scarlett contains multiple 'personality' prompts contained in the personalities.json file. Please do not modify them unless you know what you are doing and how to write json :)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unicorns18/OpenAI-Chatbot.git Scarlett

pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 chatbot.py
```

## Usage

```
Scarlett can be used either via the Command Line or through a phone number! (Twilio)
More communication methods will be implemented soon.
```
